Network Protocol
- Language that governs communication between networking devices

Cost of route
- The number of routes (jumps) it takes to go from one interface to another

SOHO 
- Small office & Home office

tracert 
- tracert is amount of hops to destination

Logical topology
- Path of how data is transferred between devices

Physical topology
- Physical arrangement of a network (cables, devices)

DNS Domain Name System

Speed (bits per second)
(bytes = 8 bits)

Uptime vs Availability
- Uptime = Number of minutes / Total number of minutes in a year [525600]
- Availability = ((Total number of minutes in a year-Downtime in minutes)/(Total number of minutes in a year ))* 100

Bus topology
- All devices connected in a line that branches off

Ring topology
- Cabled together, first device connected to last device
- Each device connected to 2 device

Star topology
- Star shape, all devices connected to a central switch

Mesh topology
- One device connects to multiple devices -> increase redundency

OSI Model (Open System Interconnect Model) - created by International Organization for Standardization (ISO)
Please do not throw sausage pizza away
- Application
- Presentation
- Session
- Transport
- Network
- Datalink
- Physical
*Each layer is independent of each other

Layer 7 Application Layer
- FTP, Telnet, HTTP
- Use protocols to communicate with lower layers
- Provides network services to application, user authentication
- Not talking about individual application
- Talking about application protocol, not the application itself

Layer 6 Presentation Layer
- Ensures that data sent by one application is "readable" by another application (MP3 can be listened to online with Windows and iOS because data is presented in a format that both side understands)
- Formats data to be presented to application layer
- Negotiates data transfer syntax for application layer
- Provides encryption
- This data must be changed to "Machine independent format"
~ Imagine opening a JPG in Notepad

Layer 5 Session Layer
- Establish, maintain and terminate of sessions between applications
- Two application processes on different machines can establish session
ex. NetBIOS (Network Basic Input/Output System)
ex. PPTP (Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol)

Layer 4 Transport Layer
- Message segmentation: segment the message in the upper layers into smaller units, then passes it down to Network layer for sending
- Handles transportation issues between hosts
- Ensures data transport reliability
- Flow control, makes sure it is not transferring more data than it can process
- Sessoin Multiplexing, multiple messages streams or sessions onto one logical link 
1) TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) 
	- reliability, maintains, and terminates virtual circuits
	- TCP 3-way handshake
	- If paket is missing, it will be retransmitted
2) UDP (User Datagram Protocol) - 
	- Does not provide reliability
	- If packets dropped, they are lost, does not retransmit lost packet

Layer 3 Network layer
- This layer is all about Data Delivery, how it routes data from one device to another 
- Concern with path determination
- 3 routing protocols in Layer 3 switches (router capable)
1) OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)
2) BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)
3) IS-IS (Intermediate Systems to Intermediate Systems)
*No reliability at this level. Must depend on TCP. If UDP is used, application layer need to provide reliability. Ex. TFTP uses UDP at Layer 4, and IP at Layer 3 = no reliability. Therefore, TFTP must provide reliability

Layer 2 Data Link
- Concerns with how data is formatted for transmission 
ex. Ethernet -> use MAC address XXXYYY = 48bits (made from OUI Organization Unique Identifier XXX + Unique Portion YYY)
- MAC Address is flat address structure VS IP Address is logically assigned. Therefore, Data Link does 
- Provides error detection
- Data link formats according to the type of Media (Ethernet, WAN link) into the appropriate Physical Link 

Layer 1 Physical
- Physical Device and Physical Cabling
- Specs of these media types

TCP/IP model
- Application Layer
- Transport Layer
- Internet Layer
- Network Access Layer

Host Communication:
- Layer 7 only talks to Layer 7 through encapsulation and decapsulation, similarly 1 -> 1 
- Encapsulation puts "header" onto the user data from L7 to L2, then FCS Frame Check Sequence occurs at the end to ensure there is no corruption

---through Physical Media as bits (0,1) ---

Transport layer transmits "Segments"
Network layer transmits "Packets"
Data Link layer transmits "Frames"
Physical layer transmits "Bits"

Protocol Data Unit (PDU) = segments, packets, frames, bits

Bits (0,1)
128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1

Hexadecimal (0-F)
0,1,2,...,9,A,B,...,F
0,1,2,...,9,10 (1010),11,...,15 (1111)
ex. 128 = 1000 0000 = 8 0 or 80 (Hexadecimal)
ex. 240 = 1111 0000 = 15 0 or F0 (Hexadecimal)

ipconfig /all | more
arp -a
telnet (ip)

Change MAC address of computer (NIC -> Configure -> Network Address)

*Ping requires ICMP Internet Control Message Protocol

RFC1918 Addresses
- Private address 10.1.1.1

IP Characteristics
- Layer 3 or network layer protocol
- Connectionless, no sessions formed. TCP on the other hand is connection oriented
- packets treated independently of other packets (packets can take different paths to get to destination)
	-> these packets go through "Routing Protocol" where it determines the bestpath from A to B (bandwidth, hopcount, load balancing)
- NO guranteed delivery or data loss recovery (corruption), IP uses "best effort delivery", again TCP will be needed if guranteed is requried

Recap IP:
- no builtin sessions
- no builtin retransmission
- TCP is needed to handle dropped, corrupted, and misdirected packets. IP relies on higher level protocol for those requriements

Before TCP can be established and any data transmitted, 3-way handshake
(Transmitter) SYN -> (Receiver)
(Transmitter) <- SYN ACK (Receiver)
(Transmitter) -> ACK (Receiver)

Address Classes IPv4
- Class A (unicast)
- Class B (unicast)
- Class C (unicast)
- Class D - multicast (one device talking to a group of device, rather than 1 to 1)
- Class E - reserved for future or experimental purposes
* classful addresses superseeded by CIDR (classless interdomain routing) in 1993
* allocated by Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)

Class A (start with binary 1 - 1XXXXXXX)
- first 8 bits = network
- Start with 1, end with 126  1.0.0.0 - 126.255.255.255
- 0 is reserved for default network, and 127 is reserved for loopback
- [00000000 network],[00000000,00000000,00000000 hosts]

Class B (start with binary 10 - 10XXXXXX)
